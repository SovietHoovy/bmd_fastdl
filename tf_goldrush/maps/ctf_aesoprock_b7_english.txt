Objective:
Grab the intel in the enemy's warden office, and take it to THEIR gas chamber to score!
Each time the intel is captured everyone has to get to an airlock, the water, or the warden's
office to survive the gas.

--Note: Map plays best with simple HUD disabled--

BETA 7 FIXES - 
-Gas works with custom sprite
-Airlocks work 
-Some hallways expanded
-Added lighting
-Fixed other small visual issues
