Introduction
------------
This is my old map es_Dynamite with updated entity work.

The first version i released was based off a new kind of gameplay i came up with which Valve soon followed on with Goldrush.

This new version has updates to it, the biggest and noticable one is the new Payload system which Goldrush uses.

-Added two new paths into the Red base to help Blu on the last CP

-Removed the two closest spawnexits for Red in Red Base, only the two in the back are used now

-Added a staircase to the back right spawn so Red can run back in to refill Health/Ammo

-Really fixed the spawnbug now (old output from an entity causing this)

-Fixed the damn alarm warning sound on the last CP spamming and then continue playing on a new round


Known Bugs:
-Have to go close to the cart two times when it starts on second path to get it to move (more like for safety)

-When you are reaching the last CP on first round the voice over doesn't say "reaching last cp"

-When the cart reaches the last CP on first round it turns it 180 degrees (because of it resetting the train and teleporting it to round 2 start position)

-Cart instantly teleports on the last CP on the last round (know how to fix but its over 3 am atm so will fix later)
