-> When you score a try or a drop in the opponents's area, your team is the only one scoring

/!\ Attention /!\

- team have to score on the opposite side
- the game ends after 40 rounds or 20 wins
- session length: 25 mn maximum
- the intel respawns 25s after a capture
- the middle force shield comes back every 5 wins for 25s 
- a general forcerespawn occurs every 10 points
- once a team drops the intel, it stays locked under its possession for 10s before becoming neutral again
- if the carrier crosses the sidelines, the intel falls
- force shield and glasses cannot be shot through
