Objective: Capture the enemy home point

Map Guide:

- The enemy home point is open when you own TWO OF THREE points.
- Points will automatically lock for a 45 second grace period after capture.
- You do not need all points in order to achieve victory
- The optional exclimation point gives a bonus to respawn and forward spawns
- Holding the ! point and A or C will activate the forward spawns

Keys To Remember:

- Defend the home point at all times, momentum can shift quickly.
- Always have at least 1 engineer.
- Use offensive engineers to lock down points.
- You DO NOT NEED ALL POINTS to win the map
