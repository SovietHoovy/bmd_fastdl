Objective:

Nuke the Enemy by stealing their Intelligence Briefcase from their Capture Zone and securing it in your Capture Zone.


Other Notes:

Players drop the Intelligence when they die. Dropped Intelligence will NOT return to its Base.

By capturing the Enemy's Intelligence a Self-Destruct Mechanism will activate. Only the CAPTURING TEAM's Capture Zone and Control Room are Safezones.

There are Three Ways to get to the Enemy's Base: Over the Bridge. Over the Cliffs. Through the Water.

Rounds will restart after a Team captures the Intelligence.
