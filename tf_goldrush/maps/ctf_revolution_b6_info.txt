Revision History

BETA 6
*  Changed name from ctf_wall to ctf_revolution
*  Added a trash chute near the intelligence to
   allow the option of a quicker exit from the 
   base building. Soldiers and demomen also can 
   potentially enter through this chute.
*  Increased the speed of spawn doors, and tweaked
   them so they wouldn't get stuck.
*  Clipped a few more things that players could get
   stuck on.
*  Added/tweaked a few more bits of detail.
*  Added a couple more health kits.

BETA 5
*  Removed street path and blocked off wall lobby.
   There are now only two ways to get through the
   wall: the upper bridge path or the hole.
*  Restructured the inside of the lower spawn
   building. Removed the stairs that were there.
   Now the second exit doesn't go off to the side,
   but up to the sniper roost and to a bridge that
   allows quick access to the upper path.

BETA 4
*  FIXED: Map now will correctly end when the
   server map timer expires.
*  Removed main base "battlements". Widened and
   detailed the back hall behind the intelligence 
   room.
*  The middle entrance that previously led down to
   the basement now instead leads up to the top
   floor hallway.
*  Adjusted a number of areas to remove falling
   damage from stepping off a ledge.
*  More detailing.

BETA 3
*  Completely moved one of the spawn rooms to 
   the buildings closest to the street. They 
   exit both to the same alley as before (just 
   from the opposite side) and into the lower 
   chamber of the base. This makes the street 
   path a lot more viable, makes the intelligence 
   room a little less defendable, and makes the 
   upper path less an exit and more an entrance.
*  Added lane dividing columns in the street 
   tunnel, and added a shortcut for 
   scouts/demomen/soldiers.
*  The ups and downs of the wall inside area 
   are now a lot more straightforward.
*  Added Buckets O' Detail.
*  Added skybox.
*  Clipped off just about everything to prevent 
   a) getting stuck and b) demomen/soldiers from 
   getting to off-limits areas. Please let me 
   know if you find anything that still needs to 
   be clipped.

BETA 2
*  Tightened up the streets and a few 
   other spaces.
*  Reduced some of the path interconnections. 
   The presence of too many options was 
   contributing to lack of team cohesion for
   uncoordinated teams (most public servers).
   Removing a few of the ways to jump from one
   path to another will focus players a bit
   more and encourage teamwork.
*  Added more signs and indicators.
*  Moved street entrance to the side and up a
   level, making the street path more attractive.
*  Added some more detail work, though I'm 
   holding off on most of the finer details 
   until after the layout is finalized.
*  Other miscellaneous tweaks and optimizations.
