Revision History

BETA 2
* Fixed "ghost" control point in sub bay.
* Fixed being able to get stuck in upper temple
  during the temple / sub bay round.
* Reworked the temple / sub bay round for better
  gameplay and hopefully it will see fewer stalemates
  and a more balanced win ratio.
* Reworked village / sub bay round. Action in the middle
  area should be less divided and more friendly to fire
  from snipers, soldiers, heavies, etc.
* Added more signs to provide player direction and to make
  death areas more apparent.
* Added a shark to the water by the boat.
* Fixed strange reflections in water.
* Improved clipping.
* Fixed players getting stuck in trick-door in village if
  they attempted to block it.
* Fixed decontamination spray in volcano / temple round.
  It had been getting turned on during the wrong round.
* Improved visibility in outside areas, so players should
  render fewer objects not in view.
* Added overtime. If any flag is not at home when the timer
  hits zero, 60 seconds of bonus time is added. However, if
  all flags get returned to home during this time, the round
  automatically ends.


BETA 1
* Added another path into village during
  volcano/village round.
* Reworked the layout inside the temple area.
* Fixed bugs involved with players crossing a few
  prop-based bridges and ramps.
* Fixed clipping on bridges across ravine.
* Deepened pool under waterfall to support players
  attempting to put out flames.
* Increased setup times. Normal rounds are 30 seconds,
  while defense rounds are 60 seconds.
* Added more health and ammo.
* Added proper collision to robot deck and hoses.
* Made robot deck a more sentry-friendly location.
* Added more direction signs.


ALPHA 4
* First major detailing pass.
* Added alternate route off floor level of volcano area.
* Removed access to most village roof areas.
* Added stairs up to the second catwalk in the red
  lair staging area.



ALPHA 3
* Added setup times. Normal rounds have 25 seconds, 
  defense rounds have 40.
* Fixed a few bugs.
* Replaced most placeholder "red walls" with actual
  doors and other more natural obstructions.
* Added to the skybox.
* Added fog transitions between some areas.
* Closed off world map so players won't get stuck 
  in it anymore.


ALPHA 2
* Switched flags to a new system to automatically
  return them if dropped in player-death spots. This
  should also fix bugs with flags spawning as the
  wrong team.
* Quite a lot of detailing to the outside. Many 
  custom assets created.
* Skybox added.
