Panda Jump BETA 3
by curbee

King of the flag gametype
Remake of Axl's Axlfly for TFC. Use the ramps to launch yourself towards the battlements or towards the hill with the intel. Hold the intel (which leaves a glow trail behind you) to win. Dropped intel returns after 3 seconds so pick it up fast when it is dropped!

BETA 2c/3 - I HATE TEXTURES. WORK DAMMIT!
BETA 2.1 - Cubemaps (hopefully) fixed.
BETA 2 - Gametype changed to King of the Flag
BETA 1 - Initial release
